Best Practices for structuring URLs. The link was found by [Craig Dennis](https://github.com/craigsdennis)
some while ago.
It helps a lot in all web development Techdegree projects, in building URLs
and providing BackEnd for them. Although some of the practices can be 
hard to be implemented easily, it is still nice to know professional
opinion on this topic.
